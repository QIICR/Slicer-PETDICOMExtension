Slicer PET DICOM Extension
=====================================
The PET DICOM Extension provides tools to import PET Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) images from DICOM into 3D Slicer. SUV computation is based on the vendor-neutral "happy path only" calculation described on the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA) wiki page [Standardized Uptake Value (SUV)][].
